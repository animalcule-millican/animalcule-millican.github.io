<h1>Amylase activity assay</h1>
<h2>Direct environmental plating</h2>
<h3>Gram negative populations:</h3>
<ol>
<li>5 g of processed soil is weighed out into a plastic weigh-boat.<ul>
<li>Record the weight of the soil sample and empty weigh-boat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Place the dry soil into 50 ml cold sterile DI-H~2~O</li>
<li>Place flask on orbital shaker at ~150 rpm for 1 h.<ul>
<li><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> It is best to shake the soil solution in the cold.<ul>
<li>If a refrigerated orbital shaker is not available, the flask can be shaken for 20 min, then refrigerated for 30 mins, and repeat until soil solution has been shaken for 1 h 20 mins.<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> This shake-refrigerate method requires longer total shaking time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once shaking is finished, serial dilute 10-fold soil solution up to 5 times, for a final 10^-5^ dilution.</li>
<li>Plate 100 ul of dilutions 10^-5^, 10^-4^, 10^-3^ on to starch agar. </li>
<li>Incubate plates at 28^o^C for 2-3 days.<ul>
<li>Incubation timing can be adjusted to meet growth rates of isolates if known</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After 2-3 days, flood plates with 1% iodine solution and allow to incubate for 10 mins.</li>
<li>After 10 mins, decant iodine solution</li>
<li>Observe colonies for clearing zones around colonies.</li>
<li>Measure diameter of all observed clearing zones.</li>

<h3>Gram-positive and spore forming populations:</h3>
<ol>
<li>5 g of processed soil is weighed out into a plastic weigh-boat.<ul>
<li>Record the weight of the soil sample and empty weigh-boat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Place the soil sample in the chemical fume hood, covered by sterile cheese cloth, for 36 h to dry.</li>
<li>Place the dry soil into 50 ml cold sterile DI-H~2~O</li>

<h2>Individual isolate</h2>
<ol>
<li>Inoculate a single isolated colony to isolate appropriate liquid rich media.</li>
<li>Incubate for 48 h at 25^o^C with shaking.</li>
<li>After incubation adjust culture to OD~600nm~ 0.1</li>
<li>Place 4-5 ul drops of adjusted culture in four quadrants of a starch agar plate, spaced equidistant from each other. <ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Unless unavoidable, do not inoculate different isolates onto the same plate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Incubate plates at 28^o^C for 2-3 days.<ul>
<li>Incubation timing can be adjusted to meet growth rates of isolates if known</li>
