<h1>Colloidal-chitin agar preparation:</h1>
<p><strong><em>Type of base media used will be determined by organisms being tested</em></strong>
1. Prepare base media according to protocol
     - Before autoclaving add 4g/L of colloidal chitin.
         - <a href="./project_files/protocols/colloidal-chitin-preparation.html">colloidal chitin preparation</a>
     - check pH and adjust to 7.2
         - Or to pH specified based on organism being tested
             - if unknown start at pH 7.2
2. Autoclave media for 30min at 121C and 15psi
3. Allow media to cool to ~65C
4. Briefly, and gently, stir media before pouring to ensure chitin is evenly distributed.
5. Pour ~10-15ml of media into petri plates until all media has been poured. 
6. Cover plates and allow to cool and dry overnight before packaging in bags and storing on shelf.</p>
