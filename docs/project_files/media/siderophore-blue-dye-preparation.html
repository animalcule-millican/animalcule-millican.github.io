<h1>Preparation of the CAS Blue agar</h1>
<h2>Protocol</h2>
<pre><code>    - This protocol is based on using MM9 minimal media
    - Not all microbes grow on MM9
    - Any media base can be used, given that that media is buffered and can be maintained at pH 6.8
        - This is very important for when mixing CAS solution with base media
    - Media known to work with CAS Blue Dye:
        - LB agar
        - Oatmeal agar
        - TSA agar
        - Potato dextrose agar
        - There are cerainly more.....

<h3>Blue Dye:</h3>
<p>A. Solution I:
    - Dissolve 0.06g CAS in 50ml DI-H~2~O
B. Solution 2:
    - Dissolve 0.0027g FeCl~3~ * 6H~2~O in 10ml of 10mM HCl
C. Solution 3:
    - Dissolve 0.073g of HDTMA in 40ml DI-H~2~O
D. Combine solutions:
    - Mix solution 1 with 9 ml of solution 2.
    - Then mix with solution 3.
    - Solution should now be blue in color.
    - Filter sterilize and store in plastic bottle in the dark.
        - Alternatively, the mixed solution can be autoclaved if appropriate filters are not available.</p>
<h3>Growth solution:</h3>
<p>A. Minimal Media 9 (MM9) salt stock solution
    - The minimal media can be changed to an isolate specific media type if needed.
    - In 500ml DI-H~2~O, dissolve:
        - 15g KH2PO4
        - 25g NaCl
        - 50g NH4Cl
    - Filter sterilize
    - Store at room temperature
B. Carbon source
    - For glucose, sucrose, mannitol, and other standard carbon sources.
        - In 100ml DI-H~2~O, dissolve:
            - 20g carbon source
        - Filter sterilize
        - Store at room temperature
C. Casamino acid solution:
    - Dissolve 3g casamino acids in 27ml of DI-H~2~O
    - Extract with 3% 8-hydrozyquinolin in chloroform to remove any trace iron
    - Filter sterilize
    - Store at room temperature</p>
<h3>CAS agar preparation:</h3>
<p>A. Add 100ml of MM9 salt solution to 750ml DI-H~2~O
B. Dissolve 32.24g PIPES buffer
    - <strong>NOTE:</strong> PIPES will not dissolve below pH 5.
        - start with pH 6, the pH will drop as PIPES dissolves
        - Slowly bring pH up to 6.8
        - DO NOT EXCEED pH 6.8
            - When adding Blue Dye in later steps, the solution will turn green and you will have to start over
C. Add 15g agar
D. Autoclave at 121^o^C and 15 psi for 20 min
E. Cool to ~50^o^C
F. Add 30ml of sterile casamino acids solution
G. Add 10ml of carbon stock solution
H. Slowly add 100ml of Blue Dye
    - pipette Blue Dye solution down the glass wall of the flask with media
    - Add while stirring just enough to mix solutions.
    - if the pH is not correct this is where the solution will turn green
    - This media can be the worst sometimes.
I. Once mixed pour into plates</p>
