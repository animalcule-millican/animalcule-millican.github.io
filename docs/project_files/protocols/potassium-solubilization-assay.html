<h1>Potassium solubilization test</h1>
<ul>
<li>microbial cultures are grown for 48h in rich liquid media.</li>
<li>5 uL of culture is placed onto Aleksandrow Agar.<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> If multiple isolates are tested on the sample plate inoculation must be a minimum of 1 cm apart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plates are then incubated at 22C for 7 days</li>
<li>A positive phenotype is a zone of clearing around the colonies.</li>
<li>At 7 days, the ability of each colony to solubilize phosphate is recorded.<ul>
<li>If a colony is positive for K-sol then the zone diameter will be measured.<ul>
<li>The clearing is measured at two perpendicular right angles.</li>
