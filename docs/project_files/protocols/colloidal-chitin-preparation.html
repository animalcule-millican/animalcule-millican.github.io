<h1>Preparation of colloidal chitin</h1>
<p><strong><em>Perform steps involving HCl in a chemical fume hood</em></strong>
1. Chitin is ground to a fine powder
    - This is if powdered chitin cannot be obtained
2. 100g of chitin powder is weighted and placed in a 1000 mL glass beaker.
3. ~300 mL 12N HCl is slowly added to beaker with gentle stirring using a glass rod.
4. Solution is left for ~ 2 hours, with stirring every 5-10 min.
5. <strong>Optional:</strong> After 2 hours, solution can be filtered using cheesecloth to remove large chunks.
6. Half of the chitin - HCl mixture is added to 1.5L Ice-cold DI-H2O.
    - Do the same for the remaining chitin - HCl mixture into a separate flask of ice-cold DI-H2O.
7. Place precipitated solution at 4C and leave overnight to increase accumulation of precipitated chitin.
8. Collect precipitate using a Buchner funnel under vacuum.
    - Vacuum filtration should be setup with a trap flask
9. Rinse precipitate with 2L of cold DI-H2O
10. Repeat step 10 three times.
11. Leave precipitate on filter with vacuum running for ~30 min to remove excess moisture.
12. Collect colloidal chitin in a glass beaker and cover with aluminum foil
13. Sterilize in autoclave for 15 min at 121C and 15psi.
14. Store at 4C</p>
